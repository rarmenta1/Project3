				<h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
				<p class="intro">
					Welcome to my page. I do not have much experience with html but so far I am loving it. It does not feel as overwhelming as java and I really enjoy working
					on html. I am looking forward to learning more this semester and hoping it just gets better from here. The resume page is...well my resume. Now that I look 
					at my resume I think I need more experience and I should really do some more volunteer work. It was a great experience and should do it again sometime. The 
					Interests page is basically about the shows, music and video games I like. I like hanging with friends but because of COVID I can not see them as much as 
					as before. I also planned on going to Mexico to visit family and friends but I could not go last year.

					Hello, my name is Rafael Armenta and I am a first year ITM major. I like to hang out with friends, play video games, learn about hardware and coding, and sleeping.
					I am still fairly new to coding but feel like I am making progress and getting better at it each time I code. I chose ITM as my major because I have always been
					interested in computers. Computer Science was my second choice but that seems way more code heavy than I wanted to.

				<p>
					Pinky is 8 years old and in case you were wondering, Pinky is a boy. He seems to be mistaken for a girl because of his name. The thing with his name is
					that we just kept the name his previous owner gave him. I had Pinky since I was in like 5th grade so I basically grew up with him.
					Anyways, he can be a troublemaker and a handful but I still love him.
